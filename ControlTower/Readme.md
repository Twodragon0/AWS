# AWS SSO (IAM Identity Center) and Control Tower Integration with Okta

This document outlines the expected benefits, changes, and steps involved in integrating **Okta** with **AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)**, as well as the introduction of **AWS Control Tower** to better manage AWS accounts and permissions across the organization.

## Overview

Integrating **Okta** with **AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)** simplifies user management, enhances security, and improves operational efficiency across multiple AWS accounts. The introduction of **AWS Control Tower** allows for centralized governance, making it easier to manage security, compliance, and account provisioning at scale.

## 1. Benefits and Changes

### 1-0. Current Issues with AWS Account and Permission Management

#### Difficulty in Horizontal Scalability
- AWS account structures become increasingly complex as resource usage grows, making it difficult to scale operations or experiment with new technologies.
- Without centralized management, creating new accounts or environments involves substantial communication and configuration efforts.
- **Example**: Setting up test environments (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) for development teams requires significant manual intervention.

#### Difficulty in Applying Security Policies
- It is challenging to apply consistent security policies across all AWS accounts. Manually configuring services like **CloudTrail**, **GuardDuty**, and **AWS Config** in each account leads to inconsistencies and increased security risks.
- **Example**: Applying consistent VPC endpoint policies, security group rules, and default IAM policies across accounts is time-consuming and error-prone.

#### Complexity in Permission Management
- Managing permissions across multiple accounts is complex, with separate IAM roles, users, and policies for each AWS account. This leads to fragmented and difficult-to-manage environments.
- Users often have difficulty understanding their exact permissions and which IAM roles are required for their tasks, leading to potential security risks or reduced efficiency.

### 1-1. AWS Control Tower

**AWS Control Tower** is a managed service that helps organizations set up and govern a secure, multi-account AWS environment based on AWS best practices.

#### Key Benefits

- **Centralized Logging and Security**: AWS Control Tower introduces a standardized multi-account environment, incorporating **Log Archive** and **Audit** accounts for centralizing security logs, such as **CloudTrail** logs, across all accounts.
  - This ensures centralized visibility of security events and consistent application of security policies.
  
- **Scalable Account Creation**: AWS Control Tower’s **Account Factory** automates the process of creating new AWS accounts with predefined security, logging, and networking configurations.
  - This makes it easier to scale AWS environments by enforcing consistent security and compliance settings across all newly created accounts.

#### As-Is vs To-Be

| As-Is                                              | To-Be                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Manual account creation with no standards          | Automated account creation using Account Factory   |
| No centralized Log Archive and Audit accounts      | Centralized Log Archive and Audit accounts         |
| Inconsistent security configuration per account    | Consistent security policy application across all accounts |

#### Additional Features

- **Guardrails**: Control Tower includes **guardrails**, which are pre-configured governance rules that help maintain security and compliance across all accounts. These can be mandatory or elective based on your organization’s needs.
- **Single Sign-On**: By integrating with **AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)**, users can access multiple AWS accounts using a single set of credentials, simplifying account access management.

### 1-2. AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) with Okta Integration

**AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)** integration with **Okta** provides a single point of authentication for managing access to multiple AWS accounts. This solution simplifies access management by eliminating the need for individual IAM users and long-term credentials, replacing them with centrally managed roles and temporary credentials.

#### Key Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users access AWS accounts through Okta's single sign-on (SSO) portal, simplifying the login process and eliminating the need for separate IAM user accounts.
- **Increased Security**: By removing long-term credentials such as IAM access keys and passwords, security is improved. Temporary credentials are issued through the SSO process, reducing the risk of compromised credentials.
- **Centralized Permission Management**: Permissions for each user are managed through **AWS SSO**, consolidating them into a single IAM role per account. This reduces the complexity of managing multiple IAM users, roles, and policies across accounts.

#### As-Is vs To-Be

| As-Is                                              | To-Be                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| IAM users with separate console and access key accounts | Okta-based SSO login with a single IAM role for all accounts |
| Password reset every 90 days for console accounts  | No long-term credentials; SSO with temporary credentials |
| Access keys for CLI access (180-day rotation)      | CLI and console access via a single SSO role       |

#### Integration with AWS IAM Identity Center

AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) can be integrated with **Okta** to provide identity federation services. Okta will act as the **Identity Provider (IdP)**, allowing users to authenticate through Okta and access AWS using their existing Okta credentials. This simplifies account management and reduces the administrative overhead associated with managing IAM users and roles across multiple AWS accounts.

For more information, visit the [AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html).

## 2. Implementation Steps

### AWS Control Tower Setup

1. **Create a Landing Zone**: Deploy AWS Control Tower to create a landing zone, which sets up the multi-account environment following AWS best practices.
2. **Configure Account Factory**: Set up the Account Factory to automate the creation of new accounts with predefined security and networking configurations.
3. **Set Up Guardrails**: Apply guardrails for governance and compliance enforcement across all AWS accounts.
4. **Enable Centralized Logging**: Configure the Log Archive and Audit accounts to centralize CloudTrail and other security logs across all accounts.

### AWS SSO and Okta Integration Setup

1. **Set Up AWS IAM Identity Center**: Configure AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) to manage access to all AWS accounts within the organization.
2. **Integrate with Okta**: Use Okta as the identity provider for AWS SSO, allowing users to authenticate through Okta and access AWS accounts with a single sign-on.
3. **Define Permission Sets**: Create permission sets in AWS SSO that define the roles and permissions users need for accessing specific AWS accounts.
4. **Migrate Users**: Migrate existing IAM users to AWS SSO by assigning them roles and permissions through Okta's integration.

## Additional Considerations

### Security
- AWS Control Tower's **guardrails** help enforce security best practices, including data protection and compliance requirements.
- By using AWS SSO with Okta, the risk of long-term credential exposure is minimized, as temporary credentials are issued for each session.

### Cost Management
- AWS Control Tower helps streamline account creation and management, reducing operational overhead. However, it’s important to monitor costs, especially when creating new test or sandbox accounts.

## Conclusion

Integrating Okta with AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) and deploying AWS Control Tower will significantly simplify account management, improve security, and enable easier scalability across multiple AWS accounts. Centralized governance, logging, and permission management will enhance operational efficiency while reducing complexity and security risks.
