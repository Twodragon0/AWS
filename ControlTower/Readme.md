### 1-2. AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO) with Okta Integration

**AWS IAM Identity Center (AWS SSO)** integration with **Okta** simplifies identity and access management for multiple AWS accounts, ensuring compliance with regulations such as **ISMS-P** and **Electronic Financial Supervisory Regulations**.

#### Key Benefits

- **Improved User Experience**: Users can access AWS accounts via a single sign-on (SSO) portal, eliminating the need for separate IAM users and reducing administrative overhead.
- **Increased Security**: Long-term credentials, such as IAM access keys and passwords, are replaced with temporary credentials issued through Okta and AWS SSO, improving security.
- **Centralized Permission Management**: Permissions are managed through AWS SSO and consolidated into a single IAM role for each account. This simplifies compliance with security policies and reduces management complexity.

#### As-Is vs To-Be

| As-Is                                              | To-Be                                              |
|----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Separate IAM users for console and CLI access      | Okta-based SSO with a single IAM role per account |
| Manual password and access key management          | No long-term credentials, temporary SSO credentials |
| Separate permissions for each user across accounts | Centralized permissions through AWS SSO            |
